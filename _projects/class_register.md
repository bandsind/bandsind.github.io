# [Rad Response Training](https://www.isu.edu/cee/research-facilities/drc/facilities/gvl/current-projects/virtual-reality-vr-projects-/)
As an undergraduate research assistant, I was granted the opportunity to contribute to an innovative Virtual Reality (VR) training simulation project. My role was mainly centerd around debugging and troubleshooting software bugs, as well as developing new features with Unity, Blender, Photon Engine and C# scripts. 

The VR training program is tailored to prepare emergency responders for the implementation of the Department of Homeland Security's critical "first 100 Minutes Response Strategy," with an emphasis on the key procedure of mapping and measuring. Throughout the simulation, participants engage in realistic scenarios that include operating radiation detection equipment, conducting surveys of contaminated areas, and employing strategies to safeguard themselves and the public. The simulation leverages sophisticated modeling of radioactive particle spread to acquaint users with fundamental radiation safety principles such as minimizing exposure time, maximizing distance from sources, and using effective shielding techniques.
